Design Unique ID Generator In Distributed Systems Mar 25, 2022  Requirements Clarifications IDs should be unique IDs should be sortable by time IDs should be 64-bit size. The system should be able to handle 10,000 IDs per second Centralised Auto Increments If we canâ€™t make auto_increments work across multiple databases, what if we just use one database? This is the approach by Flickr.  A Flickr ticket server is a dedicated database server, with a single database on it, and in that database there are tables like Tickets32 for 32-bit IDs, and Tickets64 for 64-bit IDs.
UUIDs are 128-bit hexadecimal numbers. They are easy to use and has a very low probability of collision. The system can scale very easily because each server is responsible for their own ID generation.

This approach has several drawbacks:

Does not meet requirement of 64-bits size
IDs are not ordered by time
Twitter Snowflake
This approach divides the ID into different sections.

1 bit	41 bits	5 bits	5 bits	12 bits
0	timestamp	data center id	machine id	sequence number
The IDs are made up of the following components:

Epoch timestamp - 41 bits which gives us 69 years for any custom epoch.
Data Center ID - 5 bits which gives us 32 data centers
Machine ID - 5 bits which gives us 32 machines per data centers
Sequence number - Sequence number is incremented by 1 for every ID generated on the machine. Resets to 0 every millisecond. In theory, we can support 2^12 = 4096 new IDs every millisecond.
The extra one reserved bit is to make the overall number positive.
This approach meets our requirements, however there are still several considerations:

Clock synchronization. In distributed systems, servers may not use the same clock to generate the timestamp. Popular solution to clock synchronization may be to use Network Time Protocol.
