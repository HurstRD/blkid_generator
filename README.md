Design Unique ID Generator In Distributed Systems Mar 25, 2022  Requirements Clarifications IDs should be unique IDs should be sortable by time IDs should be 64-bit size. The system should be able to handle 10,000 IDs per second Centralised Auto Increments If we canâ€™t make auto_increments work across multiple databases, what if we just use one database? This is the approach by Flickr.  A Flickr ticket server is a dedicated database server, with a single database on it, and in that database there are tables like Tickets32 for 32-bit IDs, and Tickets64 for 64-bit IDs.
